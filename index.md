I am a Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from the University of Chile.  
My main strengths are backend development, cloud computing, and optimization, with a strong passion for security—particularly applied cryptography.  

I enjoy building ideas from scratch and following them through the entire flow—from design to deployment. I also plan to pursue graduate studies to further deepen my expertise in security and cryptography.
