## **GODRHYTHM**

**Demo for the Video Game Development Workshop at the University of Chile, developed by team PIXIES.**

### Description

GODRHYTHM is a 2D rhythm/combat platformer where you must defeat the boss by dodging its attacks while hitting arrows in time with the music. Once you hit a certain number of arrows, the power bar fills, creating an aura around the player. At this point, the main character can shoot at the enemy to deal damage. Complete the challenge within the songâ€™s duration to claim victory.

### Controls

- **Movement:** WASD  
- **Hit arrows:** Arrow keys  
- **Shoot:** Press Space once the power bar is full  
- **Pause:** Esc  

### Tips

- You don't need to hit all arrows consecutively; focus on accuracy.  
- Missing arrows does not reduce your power bar, but failing while attempting to hit them will reset it.
